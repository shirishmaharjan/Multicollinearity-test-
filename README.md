# Multicollinearity test (19.01.2024)

- Multicollinearity test using python and made correlation plots for CRA (Climate Resilient Agriculture)
- Conducted correlation between 45 columns in CRA
- Found out correlation matrix and p value using pearson coeffiencnt and scipy.stats package in python.
- Removed all the values greater than -0.8 and +0.8 so that highly correlated values are discarded.
- Removed all the non significant values that is greater than 0.05 and keeping only significant values in our analysis.
